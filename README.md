### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px" height="30px">, I am Ugo!

I am an enthused software engineer with 8+ years of experience and competencies in JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, NestJs, GraphQL, React, SQL, MongoDB, Docker, PHP/Laravel, and more. 

Throughout my career, I have been deeply passionate about software development and have consistently delivered robust and scalable solutions that drive business success. My experience collaborating with cross-functional teams has helped me thrive in dynamic environments, contributing to impactful projects that meet business objectives.

Aside from coding, I'm a passionate gamer 🎮 and I love to sing 🎵.
