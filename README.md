### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px" height="30px">, I am Ugo!

I am an enthused software engineer with 5+ years of experience and competencies in Javascript, Typescript, NodeJs, NestJs, GraphQL, React, SQL, Docker PHP/Laravel, and more. 

Throughout my career, I have been deeply passionate about software development and have consistently delivered robust and scalable solutions that drive business success. My experience collaborating with cross-functional teams and leading development projects has equipped me with valuable insights into effective communication and project execution.

Aside from coding, I'm a passionate gamer and I love to sing.
